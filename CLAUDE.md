- always edit the github issue description directly when updating research or plans — don't create local files or add amendment comments
- no claude or any user attribution needed in comments, prs, commits, issues
- when we create an issue in this repo, always add it to project 3 with status backlog
- always merge from main when working in a pr branch and we need to update the branch
- when adding new config variables, always document them in .env.example with a comment explaining their purpose and default value
