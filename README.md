# Kiln

A polling-based daemon that monitors GitHub Project Kanban boards and orchestrates Claude-powered workflows for software development automation. It enables a human-in-the-loop development process where engineers move issues through kanban columns (Research → Plan → Implement) and Claude handles the execution.

## Installation and How-To

See the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) for setup instructions.

## What it looks like

| ⚪ Backlog | 🔵 Research | 🟣 Plan | 🟠 Implement | 🟡 Validate | 🟢 Done |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| *new issues* | *codebase exploration* | *design tasks* | *write code* | *human review* | *complete* |

| Column    | What Claude Does                                        | Labels                                  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Backlog   | —                                                       | —                                       |
| Research  | Explores codebase, writes findings to issue             | researching → research_ready            |
| Plan      | Designs implementation, writes plan to issue            | planning → plan_ready                   |
| Implement | Executes plan, commits code, opens PR, iterates on review | implementing → reviewing → (Validate) |
| Validate  | Nothing; Human review — merge PR when ready             | —                                       |
| Done      | Worktree cleaned up automatically                       | cleaned_up                              |

## Capabilities

### 🔥 Claude CLI as Execution Engine

Execute workflows via the `claude` CLI rather than direct API calls.

- **Zero auth setup**: Leverages existing `claude` and `gh` logins—no API keys or OAuth flows to configure
- **Commit attribution**: Git commits are attributed to the authenticated user without external auth dependencies
- **Full capabilities**: Claude CLI supports slash commands, tools, file access, and git operations
- **Streaming**: Native support for long-running operations with streaming output

### 🔥 Polling Over Webhooks

Use periodic polling instead of webhook-based event handling.

- **Security-first**: No external attack surface from exposed endpoints
- **Firewall-friendly**: Works behind VPNs without requiring publicly-accessible endpoints
- **No infrastructure**: Eliminates need for public URLs, SSL certificates, or webhook secret management
- **Simplicity**: Single process, no web server, no ngrok tunnels, no cloud functions

**Trade-off**: 30-second latency (configurable) vs. near-instant webhook response.

### 🔥 GitHub Labels as State Machine

Use GitHub labels as the primary workflow state machine rather than database state.

- **Crash recovery**: Daemon restarts automatically resume from label state
- **Visibility**: Engineers can see workflow state directly on issues
- **Manual override**: Labels can be manually added/removed to force state transitions
- **Distributed-safe**: Multiple daemon instances won't conflict

### 🔥 Issues as Product Requirements Docs

Research and plan outputs are written and iterated on in the issue description to keep a single source of truth with auditable progression.

- **Single source**: All context in one place for implementation
- **Editable**: Users can directly edit research/plan sections
- **Structured**: HTML markers (`<!-- kiln:research -->`, `<!-- kiln:plan -->`) enable targeted updates
- **Idempotent**: Markers prevent duplicate runs from creating duplicate content

### 🔥 No Comment Iteration at Validation Stage

Comment-based iteration is disabled once work reaches the PR/Validate stage.

- **Prevents bloat**: Stops "vibe coding" via comments that adds unnecessary changes to PRs
- **Token efficiency**: Avoids wasteful back-and-forth on already-implemented work
- **Forces testing**: Developers must checkout the PR locally and test manually
- **Keeps PRs clean**: Fixes are pushed directly rather than AI-appended

**Trade-off**: No comment-driven iteration on PRs. If you prefer not to checkout the branch locally, merge the PR when it's "good enough" and open new issues for remaining fixes.

## Config

1. Run `./run.sh` — first run scaffolds a fresh config file
2. Edit `.kiln/config`:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | - | GitHub PAT (classic) with required scopes |
| `PROJECT_URLS` | Yes | - | Comma-separated GitHub Project URLs |
| `ALLOWED_USERNAME` | Yes | - | GitHub username authorized to trigger workflows |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | No | 30 | Seconds between polls |
| `WATCHED_STATUSES` | No | Research,Plan,Implement | Status columns to monitor |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKFLOWS` | No | 3 | Parallel workflow limit |
| `STAGE_MODELS` | No | see below | Claude model per workflow stage |

### 🔥 Special Labels

These labels trigger autonomous workflows:

| Label | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| ![yolo](docs/label-yolo.svg) | Autonomously push through until PR is made |
| ![reset](docs/label-reset.svg) | Clears all research, plan, labels, worktrees, and sends to Backlog |

### 🔥 Stage Models Default

| Stage | Model | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Prepare | haiku | Fast, simple worktree setup |
| Research | opus | Deep codebase exploration |
| Plan | opus | Complex architectural reasoning |
| Implement: Code | opus | Code generation from plan |
| Implement: Review | sonnet | PR review iteration |
| Comment Iteration | sonnet | Feedback processing in Research/Plan |

### 🔥 GHES Log Masking

For GitHub Enterprise Server users, Kiln automatically masks sensitive hostname and organization information in log files to prevent accidental exposure.

| Config | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `GHES_LOGS_MASK` | `true` | Enable/disable log masking |

When enabled (default), logs show:
- `<GHES>` instead of your GHES hostname
- `<ORG>` instead of your organization name

Example: `github.corp.com/myorg/repo#123` becomes `<GHES>/<ORG>/repo#123`

To disable masking (e.g., for debugging), set `GHES_LOGS_MASK=false` in `.kiln/config`.

**Note**: This only applies to GHES configurations. GitHub.com hostnames are not masked.

### 🔥 Run Logs

Each workflow execution creates a dedicated log file for debugging and audit purposes. Logs are stored hierarchically by repository and issue:

```
.kiln/logs/{hostname}/{owner}/{repo}/{issue_number}/{workflow}-{timestamp}.log
```

Example:
```
.kiln/logs/github.com/acme-org/my-repo/42/research-20250121-1430.log
```

**Features:**
- **Per-run isolation**: Each workflow run gets its own log file
- **Session linking**: Companion `.session` files store Claude session IDs for linking to full conversation details
- **Database tracking**: All run metadata (timestamp, outcome, duration) stored in SQLite for querying
- **Reset-safe**: Run logs are preserved when using the `reset` label (debugging history is not deleted)

#### `kiln logs` CLI Command

View run history and logs for a specific issue:

```bash
# List all runs for an issue
kiln logs owner/repo#42

# View a specific log file by run ID
kiln logs owner/repo#42 --view 5

# Get Claude session info for a run
kiln logs owner/repo#42 --session 5
```

**Output example:**
```
Run history for owner/repo#42:

ID     Workflow     Started            Duration     Outcome
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1      research     2025-01-21 10:30   2m 45s       ✓ success
2      plan         2025-01-21 10:35   4m 12s       ✓ success
3      implement    2025-01-21 10:42   running...   ⏳ running

Use 'kiln logs <issue> --view <id>' to view a specific log file.
Use 'kiln logs <issue> --session <id>' to get Claude session info.
```

**Issue identifier formats:**
- `owner/repo#42` — assumes github.com
- `hostname/owner/repo#42` — for GitHub Enterprise Server
